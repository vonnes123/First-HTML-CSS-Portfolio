                                I was young, I have been fascinated by technology. At the start I was all about the hardware and building my own computer. However, as time went on, I became more and more interested into software. It didn’t take long for me to find a course about programming that would quench my thirst for knowledge. I went to the Software University in Bulgaria and started a course called C# fundamentals. That course gave me fundamental knowledge about <b class="bold"> C# </b>and has helped me. In the same time, I started leaning <b class="bold">HTML</b>  on the side because I found it fascinating. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I came to Fontys University of Applied Sciences I have learned a lot about: 
                            </p>
                            <p class="bold">
                                SQL, RStudio, Software engineering, Computer networking, Embedded systems, UX design, HTML and CSS

                            <p>
                                Sports have played a significant role in my life. Since very young I have always trained something. At first, I trained <b class="bold">Football</b> then I went on to do <b class="bold">Swimming</b> for 6 years after that <b class="bold">Taekwondo</b> for 2 followed by 4 years of <b class="bold">Fitness</b> and know I am doing <b class="bold">Fencing</b>.  
                            </p>
                            <p>Sports to me are very important to me because they help you stay in shape and also help your brain activity. Studies have shown that my doing exercises you boost the blood flow to the brain and parallel with that boosts the brain activity. Besides that, as people age physical exercise becomes more important because it postpones deterioration of the brain. </p>

                                Books to me are very important because they contain the wisdom of past generations. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, books can be a very relaxing way to escape daily life. And in the same time, they can be thought provoking and can influence a person deeply. For me personally there are 3 books that have influenced me deeply they are:

                                For me as a person just taking part in a competition is very important. Because there is no chance for you to <b class="bold">win</b> except if you don’t try. Even if you lose it is important that you gave it your all.

                            <b class="bold">2020 American University in Blagoevgrad Multi Talent Quest</b>. There were five different disciplines and I was able to win one of them <b class="bold">“In the SPORTlight” </b>. The competition was fierce but I was able to persevier.
